## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r ,echo=FALSE}
plot(rock[c("area","peri")])
plot(cars)
```
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
for(x in 0:100){
  print(x)

}
```

```{r}
x <- 500
while(x != 0){
  print(x)
  x <- x - 1
}
```


```{r}
names <- c("wolf","aiko","william","junko")
ages <- c("26","16","18","56")
d <- data.frame(names,ages)
d <- d[order(d$ages,decreasing = FALSE),]
for(row in 1:nrow(d)){
  print(sprintf('%s is %s',as.character(d$names[row]),as.character(d$ages[row])))
}

```
